This folder contains webscraping scripts that extract specific information about available grants listed on certain grant database websites (with grants sometimes filtered via GUIs/user-input text to ensure relevance). 

The information scraped from each website is written onto separate CSVs.

The scripts allow users a more time efficient way of finding and reading information than they would in comparison to manually searching through a website, since information is compiled into the one file.
